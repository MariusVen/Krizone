        <p>
          In high school, we are all confronted with the tension of who we want
          to be when we grow up. What do we want to do when we leave school? And
          the truth is, as a kid you only know what you are around. Sometimes
          you may know what you want to do but your culture is not accepted in
          it, or there is always that pressure from your peers. <br /><br />
          I had the privilege to grow up with art around me, so it was natural
          for me to have a desire to pursue art. When the question arose of what
          I wanted to do when I grew up? <br /><br />I answered, “Art”.
          <br /><br />
          “Why would you want to surround yourself with those boring museums?”
          responded the kid wearing Virgil Abloh’s Off-White Caravaggio hoodie….
          <br /><br />This was the moment I realised that Abloh’s streetwear
          brand Off-White opened a space for young adults to indulge in art
          history without feeling out of place. There is something in the
          fashion collections that unconsciously invites new audiences to
          explore art and design. So, I undertook a journey into exploring
          Abloh’s commercialisation of the arts for diversification.<br /><br />
          Stumbling across Jonathan Van Meter’s article in the Vogue May 2019
          edition, he described Abloh as someone who is “actually rewriting
          rules, and kids look up to it”. Captivated by the descriptions of his
          shared moments with Virgil Abloh during the rise of the Off-White
          brand, I knew there was no one better to recall Abloh’s artistic
          practice. <br /><br />Set in the mid-air of cold December with the
          power of Zoom, Jonathan Van Meter took me through his memories of the
          dear Virgil Abloh… <br /><br />
        </p>

        <h2>
          What made you want to write about Virgil Abloh and what was your
          encounter like with Virgil?
        </h2>
        <p class="article-answers">
          <b>Jonathan Van Meter:</b> So, Anna Wintour asked me if I wanted to
          write about him and I said yes immediately because I had interviewed
          him on the phone about Kendall Jenner and I was so struck by it.
          Usually, you know when you do phone interviews with people about a
          subject and you are on the phone with them for ten or fifteen minutes
          but with him, we just talked and talked. He had so much to say, and I
          could just see that his mind was just ripe and that he thinks so
          deeply about so many things that most people don’t bother to think
          about. So, when Vogue asked me to write about him, I said yes right
          away.<br /><br />
          I went to Paris... he was preparing a collection for Off-White, and we
          spent a lot of time hanging out at his atelier and also at Louis
          Vuitton. I hung out with him backstage whilst he was getting ready to
          do the show for Off-White and then I went to Chicago a few months
          later and spent some time with him in his hometown. We had an intense
          connection. I have been writing profiles for people for 30 years and I
          often connect really well with people, but this was sort of different.
          <br /><br />I had been the founding editor-in-chief of Vibe Magazine
          and he as a young person had been obsessively reading Vibe Magazine in
          the ‘90s and we discovered this amazing connection in that department.
          We could have talked for hours. He takes the time to explain himself
          and he has complicated ideas about things, and we were surrounded by
          art and furniture and fashion at the highest level in Paris. And just
          seeing him kicking around with his crew at Louis Vuitton was
          fascinating and elevating. It felt like I was watching someone master
          like a three-way circus basically mastering so many things at the same
          time.

            >And the whole hype beast circulation at the time.<br /><br />
            His work almost feels like an archival documentation of his work
            throughout his life. </i
          ><br /><br />For sure that is a good way to look at it. A good word
          for it.<br /><br /><br /><br />
          It is visible that Abloh brought so much positivity to those around
          him and opened the art doors to many outsiders.<br /><br />
          In loving memory of Virgil Abloh.<br /><br />
