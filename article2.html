        <p>
          In high school, we are all confronted with the tension of who we want
          to be when we grow up. What do we want to do when we leave school? And
          the truth is, as a kid you only know what you are around. Sometimes
          you may know what you want to do but your culture is not accepted in
          it, or there is always that pressure from your peers. <br /><br />
          I had the privilege to grow up with art around me, so it was natural
          for me to have a desire to pursue art. When the question arose of what
          I wanted to do when I grew up? <br /><br />I answered, “Art”.
          <br /><br />
          “Why would you want to surround yourself with those boring museums?”
          responded the kid wearing Virgil Abloh’s Off-White Caravaggio hoodie….
          <br /><br />This was the moment I realised that Abloh’s streetwear
          brand Off-White opened a space for young adults to indulge in art
          history without feeling out of place. There is something in the
          fashion collections that unconsciously invites new audiences to
          explore art and design. So, I undertook a journey into exploring
          Abloh’s commercialisation of the arts for diversification.<br /><br />
          Stumbling across Jonathan Van Meter’s article in the Vogue May 2019
          edition, he described Abloh as someone who is “actually rewriting
          rules, and kids look up to it”. Captivated by the descriptions of his
          shared moments with Virgil Abloh during the rise of the Off-White
          brand, I knew there was no one better to recall Abloh’s artistic
          practice. <br /><br />Set in the mid-air of cold December with the
          power of Zoom, Jonathan Van Meter took me through his memories of the
          dear Virgil Abloh… <br /><br />
        </p>

        <h2>
          What made you want to write about Virgil Abloh and what was your
          encounter like with Virgil?
        </h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 50px">
          <b>Jonathan Van Meter:</b> So, Anna Wintour asked me if I wanted to
          write about him and I said yes immediately because I had interviewed
          him on the phone about Kendall Jenner and I was so struck by it.
          Usually, you know when you do phone interviews with people about a
          subject and you are on the phone with them for ten or fifteen minutes
          but with him, we just talked and talked. He had so much to say, and I
          could just see that his mind was just ripe and that he thinks so
          deeply about so many things that most people don’t bother to think
          about. So, when Vogue asked me to write about him, I said yes right
          away.<br /><br />
          I went to Paris... he was preparing a collection for Off-White, and we
          spent a lot of time hanging out at his atelier and also at Louis
          Vuitton. I hung out with him backstage whilst he was getting ready to
          do the show for Off-White and then I went to Chicago a few months
          later and spent some time with him in his hometown. We had an intense
          connection. I have been writing profiles for people for 30 years and I
          often connect really well with people, but this was sort of different.
          <br /><br />I had been the founding editor-in-chief of Vibe Magazine
          and he as a young person had been obsessively reading Vibe Magazine in
          the ‘90s and we discovered this amazing connection in that department.
          We could have talked for hours. He takes the time to explain himself
          and he has complicated ideas about things, and we were surrounded by
          art and furniture and fashion at the highest level in Paris. And just
          seeing him kicking around with his crew at Louis Vuitton was
          fascinating and elevating. It felt like I was watching someone master
          like a three-way circus basically mastering so many things at the same
          time.

        <h2>
          Would you say he was different from other fashion designers you
          encountered in the past?
        </h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 50px">
          Most fashion designers do not study architecture and go to college for
          all those years. He stands out as an academic. He has an academic way
          of approaching everything. I think of him as a multipotentialite, a
          person who is capable of doing anything. He could be an architect, he
          is an amazing marketer, an artist, he makes furniture, he could be an
          academic professor. You just had the sense that he had the potential
          to be anything. A DJ. That’s what set him apart from any other fashion
          designer I ever met.
        </p>
        <h2>Do you see Virgil Abloh as an artist?</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 50px">
          He almost starts his designs from a different place. Unlike some
          designers who create a mood board of different fabrics, colours, and
          feelings. It feels like it comes from a different point of view, a
          different source, a different place. I see it as the architect in him.
          The way you would go about designing a great big modern building is to
          look at the environment around the building and see what fits into
          that physical urban space. That’s how I saw it. Tweaking with objects
          that we are familiar with and turning them into something completely
          different. Like the luggage tags, taking mundane objects and elevating
          them and recontextualising objects. That to me, is something that
          artists do.
          <br />
        </p>

        <p>
          <i
            >In a sense, his practice is an appropriation of art for a positive
            cause in creating access to art…</i
          >
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 50px">
          Yeah, it’s sort of. I remember once seeing this piece of art called
          Slab. This was like fifteen years ago and my husband is an art person,
          and I would sometimes laugh at the art stuff we were seeing like
          “What!?” It was a giant slab of concrete, and it was elevated just off
          the floor. And it was beautiful, but it looked like a patio!<br /><br />
          <i>*We share a laugh*</i> <br /><br />Andy said to me “The artist is
          asking you to consider it in a different way and to think about its
          environment.” So, I have always carried that around with me whenever I
          get a little eye-rolly about certain modern art. And I remember having
          that thought with Virgil, he is asking you to reconsider this idea,
          this thing, this object. To look at it with new eyes.
          <br />
        </p>
        <h2>
          100%. I particularly liked when you wrote “he is rewriting the rules
          and many kids look up to it”. Do you think the commercial element
          helped to attract the youth? But did this not commercialise the
          museum?
        </h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 50px">
          The way I can answer that is that when I was in Paris spending time
          with Virgil I also hung out one day with an American student living in
          Paris. <br /><br />
          One of my best friends is a lawyer and her daughter had just enrolled
          into university in Paris and she was 19 at the time. We wandered
          around Paris and had fun and she was obsessed with Virgil Abloh and
          all her friends were. And I was surprised by that, a group of
          college-age men and women were fabulous enough to be in Paris, but
          they were aware of everything he did. I was really surprised by that.
          It made me think he is actually getting through to young people. There
          is something between the combination of the brand and the streetwear
          aspect and the elevation.19-year-olds don’t care about high
          fashion.They are so hyper-focused on their little worlds and for him
          to have cracked through into their world of interest, that spoke to
          me.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >Exactly. That’s what I’m trying to establish. His brand attracted
            young generations to go into the museums breaking away from the
            negative stereotypes.But I wonder if he would have had the same
            voice authority if he was not a luxury brand. In a way, the high
            price point enabled him to enter the conversation.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 50px">
          Well, Louis Vuitton took it to a new level. But I would be so curious
          to know, with the curator at the Chicago Museum, who attended and what
          was the attendance like.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >I have spoken to Michael Darling; he was the curator of the Chicago
            exhibition, and he said the exhibition opened the door to new
            audiences that previously did not attend the museum. And as long as
            they were coming in through the door, that is what mattered because
            it was opening the idea of art.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 50px">
          I think it is rare what he did-to cross these worlds, to bring young
          black urban kids into Chicago into a fancy museum.That is hard to pull
          off-and rare. You can’t just decide you want to be that and make that
          happen. It has to be in you. It was in his nature.
        </p>
        <h2>
          In your conversations with Abloh, did he mention what his overall
          vision was with the Off-White brand?
        </h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 50px">
          The thing that does stick with me is him talking about wanting to
          reach people who were not necessarily natural buyers or participants
          in such a brand.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >Indeed, I think the way he planned everything was to reach a new
            audience and I like when you mentioned in your Vogue article that it
            is an empowered brand. However, there are some critics of Virgil’s
            work regarding the trademark, reproductions, and the copyright
            associations with it and so I wondered what you would say to those
            who criticise him for stealing ideas and appropriating other
            artists’ work.></i
          >
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 50px">
          I always thought that criticism about him fell flat for me. Everything
          is synthesized references. Every song, every TV show. You know I was
          watching some TV show the other day and I was like, “Wow this is like
          literally a scene right out of a movie that I saw recently that is
          like from thirty years ago. It just feels like borrowing is the coin
          of the realm now.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >I think it is common language especially because artworks such as
            the Mona Lisa don’t have any copyright protection so you can’t
            really criticise him for that.</i
          ><br /><br />
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 50px">
          I also thought there was something punk rock and brave about going
          right up to the edge and stealing and seeing how far you could push
          it. As a person writing a book right now and looking at all these
          sources that are laying on my desk, I have scribbled on everything.
          I’m stealing all this stuff and it feels like that is what art is
          now.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >I mean he came up with the 3% rule, in which he said if you change
            3% of the design, it is technically a new design.</i
          ><br /><br />
          I mean yeah, I was writing a few paragraphs that were a mash-up of
          these two different books that I have and discuss the same story.
          There is this one story that I wanted to tell and so I compared them
          and reread them three times and then I let it sink in overnight. Then
          I wrote my own new version of the combination of those two versions of
          the same story. I found myself borrowing a couple of terms and
          phrases. And it’s the same thing, the same gist.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >Indeed, it happens everywhere. I just think it’s a common language
            now. Some people I have been talking to have said they think all
            that criticism was just a racist attack on him.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 50px">
          One thing that I found remarkable about him was that he really
          resisted everything turning into a discussion about race. He really
          did not default to accusations of racism very easily he had to be
          convinced of that.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >I mean those comments about him becoming the first black director
            of Louis Vuitton that wasn’t all down to race. It was all credit to
            his work and designs and the build-up to it.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 50px">
          Yeah, and you know Louis Vuitton they did need to diversify. They
          picked the right guy though. If they were going to hire someone
          because they were black, if that was one of the motivations, at least
          they made the right call.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Do you know how that selection process went about and who the other
          candidates were?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I just remember the whole sort of Kayne Virgil vibe that was taking
          over Paris and beginning to change Paris fashion. They were behind,
          and they had to catch up. <br /><br /><i
            >And the whole hype beast circulation at the time.<br /><br />
            His work almost feels like an archival documentation of his work
            throughout his life. </i
          ><br /><br />For sure that is a good way to look at it. A good word
          for it.<br /><br /><br /><br />
          It is visible that Abloh brought so much positivity to those around
          him and opened the art doors to many outsiders.<br /><br />
          In loving memory of Virgil Abloh.<br /><br />
