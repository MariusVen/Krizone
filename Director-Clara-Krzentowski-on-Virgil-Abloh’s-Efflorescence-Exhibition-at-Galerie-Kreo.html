        <p class="article-answers">
          Virgil Abloh is often described as the modern Andy Warhol, the pioneer
          of the link between art, fashion, and culture. Warhol understood the
          inverse: that art and culture could be translated into a commodity
          form called business art to make art more accessible. Possibly born
          from Warhol’s expressions, the art market today is governed by
          celebrity proximity, contributing an integral part to artwork’s
          exposure. Since these spaces are centres of communicating and
          distributing ideas, Abloh shared the same belief as Warhol that
          celebrity presence can bring in a wider audience.<br /><br />
          In conversation with Clara Krzentowski, director of Galerie Kreo, I
          wanted to uncover if Virgil Abloh’s blurring of celebrity culture and
          art in his Efflorescence 2019 exhibitions in Paris and London
          contributed to audience diversification within the gallery.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Did Virgil Abloh’s exhibition bring a new audience into the gallery?
        </h2>
        <p class="article-answers">
          <b>Clara:</b> This exhibition achieved a record-breaking attendance
          for us; the gallery was constantly full from the day that the show
          opened to the day it ended. One of the things we loved most about
          that, and which felt most special, was the ability to connect with a
          new, and notably young audience - some of whom hadn't been in a museum
          or gallery space before. Virgil had the power to do that: take these
          'white cube' environments, which can often appear intimidating or
          daunting to newcomers, and transform them into open spaces for
          conversation and meaningful dialogue.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Did these visitors truly engage with the artworks and what was the
          long-term influence when Virgil Abloh’s name was no longer attached to
          the upcoming exhibitions?
        </h2>
        <p class="article-answers">
          I think when one has a passion about art, or somebody's creative work,
          in this case Virgil, it already denotes a certain kind of
          open-mindedness, an openness to engage with new creative enterprises.
          The people who came to visit Virgil's show engaged deeply with the
          pieces, and we were pleased to reconnect with some of these visitors
          in subsequent shows at the gallery.
        </p>
        <h2>
          The return of visitors to Galerie Kreo shows Abloh’s capacity as a
          cultural communicator. The essence of his work in introducing the art
          environment and concepts to a fresh mindset is the long-awaited social
          change needed in the art world. But did people just attend for the
          celebrity culture?
        </h2>
        <p class="article-answers">
          It's true that the white cube space is often seen as an intimidating
          one, and that the art world, at times, may come across as overly
          highbrow. What sets Virgil's approach apart is his ability to break
          down these barriers. He successfully challenges the notion that
          exhibition spaces are exclusive and seemingly uninviting, creating
          instead an atmosphere of openness. This inclusiveness lies at the
          heart of his "EFFLORESCENCE" collection, where the concept revolves
          around bringing elements of the outdoors inside. For instance, the
          presence of a bench reminiscent of a skating bench indoors serves as a
          reminder of public spaces and streets, blurring the lines between the
          gallery and the everyday. Celebrity culture isn't something that ever
          transpired in the collection or the exhibition; everybody who came
          genuinely engaged with the content of what Virgil made.

        <h2>
          Did Galerie Kreo consider the criticism around Virgil Abloh’s practice
          of reproduction and appropriation?
        </h2>
        <p class="article-answers">
          The concept of reproduction and appropriation has a longstanding
          presence in the world of art. Artists such as Andy Warhol and Marcel
          Duchamp, whom Virgil Abloh referred to as his "lawyer," have employed
          these techniques and created incredible work from it. The focus is not
          on the imagery itself but rather on how it is used and the new meaning
          it can convey in a fresh context. <br /><br />In Virgil's case,
          context plays a pivotal role, and the act of "sampling" or
          incorporating existing imagery becomes an artistic statement. When
          someone possesses such significant influence, there will inevitably be
          detractors, but this was never a cause for concern for us. Virgil's
          brilliance is unquestionable.

        <p>
          Essentially, celebrity status is the way culture attains its value.
          Through my journey in exploring Abloh’s work, it is visible that his
          cultivation of a highly established personal image framed him in a
          position of power and voice authority to diversify the arts. Visible
          in the audience demographic changes at Galerie Kreo, it is safe to say
          that Abloh’s circulation in the high realm of fashion whilst linking
          to street style produced an aura the youth wanted to participate in
          and thus entered Abloh’s exhibitions. <br /><br />We must thank
          Galerie Kreo for opening their space to Abloh’s vision and aiding this
          necessary social change in diversifying the art industry.
