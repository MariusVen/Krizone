          A conversation on her personal style, cultural influences and
          Instagram as an artistic practice
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 13px">BY VANESA KRIZONYTE</p>

        <p>
          A fashion show on the roll, Caroline Ebo will be there bringing an
          array of sunshine through her welcoming smile and style. She is not
          your typical Norwegian influencer, you will catch her in vibrant
          colours, sparkly Dolce & Gabbana handbags and statement jewellery. In
          the mix of her busy schedule from running to photoshoots to attending
          fashion shows, we managed to catch Caroline for a chat about her
          creative outputs.

        <h2>
          Vanesa: What has drawn you to fashion and who is your fashion icon?
        </h2>
        <p class="article-answers">
          <b>Caroline Ebo:</b> Fashion came to me from a very young age. My mum
          and dad were always into fashion and used cameras around to do
          photography and videography. I think watching that, I probably got
          inspired and enjoy doing that as well. I’m from a very small town in
          Norway, like a summer town, and there is not much going on there. So
          when I first came to London and studied here, it opened my eyes to a
          whole new world, where I got inspired by everything I saw on the
          street and how people were dressed. I would say my fashion icon has
          been changing but I think for sure in recent years it's been Elsa
          Hosk, first because she’s Scandinavian and she’s not a typical
          Scandinavian and especially her new brand I think she’s killing it!
        </p>
        <h2>
          Is there anything from your Norwegian culture that you mix with your
          London style?
        </h2>
        <p class="article-answers" style="margin-top: -10px">
          I think that Scandinavian outfits and how people dress there is a very
          specific type. For me, I think it is a little bit boring because I
          like a lot of colours and to kind of mix and match. It all depends on
          my daily mood.With Scandinavian style, it is very minimalistic and it
          is very versatile.I just feel like fashion is so much more. I do have
          Scandinavian pieces in my wardrobe but more colourful stuff and edgy
          pieces.
        </p>

        <h2>What is your favourite fashion show that you have attended?</h2>
        <p class="article-answers" style="margin-top: -10px">
          They are all so different. For me, it’s not only about the fashion
          show. I love the visual part, the venue, and the music they put
          together for it. For example, last year I went to the Jil Sander show.
          It was very Y2K with blue lights and mysterious, like a Gen Z vibe and
          futuristic. Now I feel we become more into a neutral, minimalistic
          style again. My favourite for this season was Holzweiler not only
          because they are a Norwegian brand, but I think they just smashed it
          in their last collection.They had it outside and it was raining. So it
          just brought a unique feeling. It’s outside where no one else has a
          show and everyone has their umbrellas. It’s a moment that you won’t
          forget more than just having a usual runway. Bird sounds around the
          speakers, it was just magical.

        <h2>
          Do you think architecture is an important play when it comes to
          fashion shows?
        </h2>
        <p class="article-answers" style="margin-top: -10px">
          Minimalism can be beautiful in so many ways. But I think architecture
          is just an amazing way to attract people to take photos. I mean at the
          end of the day, what fashion shows want is for people to take photos
          and videos.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Do you think influencers are changing the fashion sphere?</h2>
        <p class="article-answers" style="margin-top: -10px">
          I think it was easier to identify your personal style before Instagram
          because now I feel like unintentionally you get influenced by every
          style and person.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>What makes an Instagram post for you?</h2>
        <p class="article-answers" style="margin-top: -10px">
          <b>Caroline Ebo:</b> I look at my Instagram as my portfolio and a way
          for me to express my creativity. I can combine creativity in
          photography and play around with all different film cameras, filters
          or edits and combine that with collaborations and working with brands
          that I love.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: -10px">
          <b>Vanesa:</b>
          <i
            >I agree, so much creativity goes into an Instagram post. As an art
            historian, I have covered so many different art periods and I may be
            wrong saying this but we had Impressionism and things like that, now
            I think the practice of creating an Instagram post is some sort of
            art technique and a new art movement. I hope that in the future when
            we teach categories of art, there will be a category called
            Instagram.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p class="article-answers" style="margin-top: -10px">
          I think every person on Instagram or at least so many people that I
          follow, how they do their layouts on their feed I think all of that is
          art. There is so much effort, time and planning that goes into every
          single Instagram post. I think people who don’t work with it don’t
          understand and they can’t relate.
        </p>

        <h2>
          We have always seen art and fashion being blurred together in history
          but now I feel more than ever fashion has been blended into art
          spaces. Take Gucci and 180 Studios, they have done an art
          exhibition.What is your opinion on blurring the boundaries between art
          and fashion? Do you think it is helping to open doors?
        </h2>
        <p class="article-answers" style="margin-top: -10px">
          <b>Caroline Ebo:</b> I feel like fashion goes under art. As you
          mentioned with Gucci and Cosmos, I went there Saturday and I think it
          is just such an amazing way of getting a dig deep into the history of
          it but also the visual parts. It is a clever way of doing it because
          it is going to get more marketing. The same way it was with Yayoi
          Kusama, they had these massive installations that were hanging in
          Paris and London. I think everyone was just looking at that and wanted
          to take photos of it. I don’t see a reason why it wouldn’t be amazing
          just to combine the two of them because who doesn’t want a cool unique
          fashion piece? It’s a free little exhibition. I love the combination
          of the two.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Is this not a commercialisation of the arts?</i>
        </p>
        <p class="article-answers">
          I think it has opened up my eyes to new artists because they are
          collaborating with fashion brands. I think it's a new way for artists
          to do art and to get out of their comfort zone, thinking outside the
          box and putting their art on different fashion pieces and having
          people walking around with their pieces.<br />
        </p>
        <p style="margin: -15px 0 -15px 0">
          <i>
            I agree the white cube gallery can be quite intimidating sometimes.
            I think places like Instagram and fashion help to take art out of
            the institutions which is important for the future of art.</i
          >
        </p>

        <p class="article-answers">Like a walking exhibition. <br /></p>

        <p style="margin: -15px 0 -10px 0">
          <i>Exactly. It’s a new way to showcase art.</i>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="article-answers" style="margin-top: -10px">
          I also feel like now I wouldn’t be the typical person to go to a
          gallery. I mean I can see beauty in the pieces that are hanging on the
          wall but I have some sort of ADHD and don’t have patience. I can’t
          walk around there and stand there and analyse a photo for me, I need
          something more. So I feel like for people that are not necessarily
          born and raised dying for art I think this is a better case of
          showcasing and introducing an artist.<br />
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: -15px">
          <i>This is exactly why we need to blur fashion and art!</i>
        </p>
        <h2>What are your fashion predictions for 2024?</h2>
        <p class="article-answers">
          I think definitely some of the fashion styles that have been going on
          in 2023 or the last couple of months will go into 2024. For example,
          tall socks in all different shapes and forms like tight socks, tennis
          socks and grey wool socks to have them knee high with ballerinas. That
          came very late summer and now it's going into fall and I feel like
          people are not done with it yet, so it will go into 2024. I think mini
          shorts in Miu Miu style, puffer blazers, jackets and big statement
          jewellery. This is all necessary to have in your wardrobe if you want
          to follow the trends.

        <p>
          Caroline Ebo has shown us that there are no rules in fashion. We
          should not be confined to a style or aesthetic because there is
          nothing wrong with mixing pieces. The essence of art is found in the
          power of seeing creativity in any expression. If we pause and value
          the creative gestures that go into the making of an Instagram post we
          can truly discover that art is around us and in our reach.
